            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Aeon for Ocean is a Minnesota-based non-profit that helps kids become advocates for the Ocean. Our projet’s goal was to redeign the Aeon for Ocean website to improve the user experince, such that users are successful based on the number of volunteer activities they join, time spent interacting with the educational content, and money raised via donations.  </p>
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p> Through the University of Minnesota’s UX Bootcamp, I worked with a team of three other students as joint UX researchers and designers to complete a three-week, user-centered responsive redesign of Aeon for Ocean’s website. This timeline included qualitiative user research and two rounds of iterations with user testing to arrive at our final prototypes. </p>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Aeon for Ocean seeks to increase childhood ocean activism through its online educational content, its “Krill 2 Whale program” for kids, and in-person volunteer activities such as lake beach clean ups. A preliminary heuristic analysis of their website shoed that Aeon for Ocean was not meeting these goals, as they did not provide easy access to its in-person learning opportunities or child-friendly educational content. Additionally, parents found the organization hard to trust because was unclear what the organization does regularly.

        <h3 class="display-4 heuristicEvaluation"> Early on, we completed a heuristic evaluation of the existing website, and found that the site struggled to show a clear purpose, featured a disorganized navigation system, and did not prioritize its child users despite having a large segment of its content targeted toward them. 
         We also completed a competitor analysis to see how Aeon for Ocean’s website compared to other similar webites. We found that competitor sites featured clear missions and prioritized high-quality visual content and interactivity for children.
